TEXT INDEXING

IMPORTANT! Make sure the text file encoding of your IDE is set to UTF-8.

*** For Eclipse, go to "Preferences > General > Workspace > Text file encoding".

This program indexes the words of a text file to its corresponding paragraph number by ignoring stop-words. 

A search for words can be performed and the program will display the paragraphs numbers it belongs.

Search format:

•	“data”
•	“big” and “data”
•	“algorithm” or “data”
•	“big” and (“algorithm” or “data”)
•	“big” or (“algorithm” and “data”)
